Problem Statement-
Manual attendance recording in educational institutions often leads to errors, time consumption, and difficulty in maintaining long-term records. Traditional paper-based systems can be easily misplaced, are not secure, and make it challenging to track attendance efficiently.
To overcome these limitations, there is a need for a simple, reliable, and automated system that can digitally record student attendance with accurate timestamps, securely store the data, and allow easy retrieval whenever required. 

Scope of the project-
The scope of this project covers the development of a simple, menu-driven Python-based attendance management system that automates the process of recording and viewing student attendance. The system allows users to mark attendance by entering basic details such as roll number and name, while automatically recording the date and time. It stores all attendance data in a CSV file, enabling easy retrieval, long-term storage, and compatibility with spreadsheet tools like Excel.
This project focuses on essential functionalities such as file creation, data storage, and attendance retrieval. It is designed for small-scale use, such as classrooms, tuition centers, or small training batches where advanced features like biometric scanning or online databases are not required. The system provides a reliable, user-friendly, and efficient method for managing attendance using only basic Python programming concepts and built-in modules.
